<h1>Handling the Reset Button on the Nintendo Wii</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p>On the Nintendo Wii, the reset button needs to be monitored periodically to reset the machine if the end-user presses it. If the user presses and releases the button before you act on it, you can miss the reset and fail to restart the game. <br> </p><p>At first, it sounds likes this would be no problem in Bink - you'd just check it in your playback loop. However, in one unusual case, it is possible for Bink to stall long enough that you miss the reset button press. <br> </p><p>The scenario is that the user pops the top open on the Wii, which causes a read error. Your game sees the error and then calls <a href="BinkClose.html">BinkClose</a> to end playback. However, right at that moment, the user shuts the door again! This causes <a href="BinkClose.html">BinkClose</a> to stall in the shutdown until the DVD spins up (which it has to do because Bink can't free it's memory until the pending I/Os are complete or cancelled - which doesn't happen until <i>after</i> the spin up). If the user then presses the reset during this DVD spin up time, then it is possible that you will miss it and the game won't restart. <br> </p><p>To solve this problem, you should use the Wii system function, OSSetResetCallback. This function will call you back when the reset button is pressed, and you can then handle everything properly (by setting a flag or whatever). <br> </p><p>I know that this is a really obscure situation, but Nintendo does test for it, so make sure you handle it correctly! </p>
