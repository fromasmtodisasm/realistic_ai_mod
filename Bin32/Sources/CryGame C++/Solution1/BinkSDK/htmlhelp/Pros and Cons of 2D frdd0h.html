<h1>Pros and Cons of 2D Software Blitting under Win32</h1>
<h4>Discussion</h4>
<p><b>The RAD software blitters are good, because:</b> </p><p>1) They always work and always look the same. You don't have to worry about the hardware failing or behaving weirdly. </p><p>2) They are actually faster than hardware on high-end machines like Pentium IIIs and Athlons. </p><p>3) They run better on better hardware - the faster the machine the faster the blitting (that also works in reverse, though - the slower the machine the slower the blitting). </p><p>4) You get guaranteed stretching for 2x width, 2x height, and 2x width and height. Some YUV hardware can't do any stretching at all! </p><p><br> <b>The RAD software blitters are bad, because:</b> </p><p>1) It's even more thinking for the CPU to do! On a P3 and up, doing the blitting is no big deal. On lower-end, older machines, software blitting will chew up a lot of time (you can use the 1x interlaced mode to save time on these machines, though). </p><p>2) The software blitters do no clipping at all. </p>
